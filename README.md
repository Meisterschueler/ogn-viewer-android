# OGN Viewer - FLARM Radar

## Description
Android app that visualizes the aircraft traffic from [The Open Glider Network project (OGN)](http://glidernet.org) on a map.

OGN can receive signals from gliders, tow planes, helicopters, etc.

This app is a flight radar for small aircraft with FLARM equipment.

The decoded signals can be used with apps like XCSoar on TCP port 4353.

Current version: 1.4.4

See [release notes](release-notes.md) for details.

Download the app at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meisterschueler.ognviewer


## Features
Track aircraft with FLARM devices via the OGN and see OGN receivers on a map.

See flight paths of aircraft - track only (default) or with heights (multicolor option in settings).
